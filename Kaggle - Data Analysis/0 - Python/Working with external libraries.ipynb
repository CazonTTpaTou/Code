You wrote a function `conditional_roulette_probs` which returned a dictionary with counts of how often the wheel landed on `x` then `y` for each value of `x` and `y`.\n\nAfter analyzing the output of your function, you've come to the following conclusion: for each wheel in the casino, there is exactly one pair of numbers `a` and `b`, such that, after the wheel lands on `a`, it's significantly more likely to land on `b` than any other number. If the last spin landed on anything other than `a`, then it acts like a normal roulette wheel, with equal probability of landing on any of the 11 numbers (* the casino's wheels are unusually small - they only have the numbers from 0 to 10 inclusive).\n\nIt's time to exploit this quirk for fun and profit. You'll be writing a roulette-playing agent to beat the house. When called, your agent will have an opportunity to sit down at one of the casino's wheels for 100 spins. You don't need to bet on every spin. For example, the agent below bets on a random number unless the last spin landed on 4 (in which case it just watches)."
