These lessons are aimed at those with some previous coding experience who are looking to add Python to their repertoire or level up their Python skills. (If you're a first-time coder, you may find this course a bit too fast-paced. You may want to check out [these \"Python for Non-Programmers\" learning resources](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers).)\n\nThis first lesson will cover a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic operators. If you have previous Python experience, you may want to [skip straight to the exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/1275163).\n\n> These lessons borrow and adapt some content from [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/whirlwind-tour-of-python-index).

Python is prized for its readability and the simplicity of its syntax (with some going as far as to call it \"executable pseudocode\"). \n\nNote how we indicated which code belongs to the `if`. `\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"` is only supposed to be printed if `spam_amount` is positive. But the later code (like `print(viking_song)`) should be executed no matter what. How do we (and Python) know that?\n\nThe colon (`:`) at the end of the `if` line indicates that a new \"code block\" is coming up. Subsequent lines which are **indented** (beginning with an extra 4 spaces) are part of that code block. You may be familiar with other languages which use `{`curly braces`}` to mark the beginning and end of code blocks. Python's use of meaningful whitespace often is surprising to programmers who are accustomed to other languages, but in practice it can lead to more consistent and readable code than languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks. \n\nThe later lines dealing with `viking_song` are not indented with an extra 4 spaces, so they're not a part of the `if`'s code block. We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we start defining functions and using loops.\n\nThis code snippet is also our first sighting of a **string** in Python:\n\n```python\n\"But I don't want ANY spam!\"\n```\n\nStrings can be marked either by double or single quotation marks. (But because this particular string *contains* a single-quote character, we might confuse Python by trying to surround it with single-quotes, unless we're careful.)"
