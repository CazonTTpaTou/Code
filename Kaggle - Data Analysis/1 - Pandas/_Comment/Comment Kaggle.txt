Thanks for your great tutorials about pandas. These exercices are really a tricky but useful training... 

For the question number 8, about rounding reviews scores, it seems that the nearest half-point is given by an inferior rounding compute. For example, 4.8 would have 4.5 as nearest half-point, but in fact 4.8 is closer of 5.0. 

So, if we wanted apply a classic half-point rounding, maybe  the following instruction would be a better fit :

             ***.map(lambda v : round(v * 2, 0) /2 )*** 

Have a  nice day !
