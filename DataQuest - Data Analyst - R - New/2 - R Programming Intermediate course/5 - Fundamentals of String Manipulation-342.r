## 1. Working With Strings ##

library(readr)
scores <- read_csv("scores.csv")

## 2. Subsetting Strings by Position ##

match_month <- str_sub(scores$match_date,-4,-1)

## 3. Splitting Strings ##

match_matrix <- str_split(scores$match_date," ",simplify=TRUE)

scores <- scores %>% 
        mutate(match_month = match_matrix[,2])



## 4. Calculating Average Goals Per Month ##

scores <- scores %>%
    mutate(total_goals = scores$home_goals + scores$away_goals)

avg_monthly_goals <- scores %>%
                    group_by(match_month) %>%
                    summarize(mean(total_goals))



## 5. Combining Strings ##

scores <- scores %>% 
        mutate(lose_country = if_else(win_country == home_country, away_country, home_country))
        
team_results <- str_c(scores$win_country, " beat ", scores$lose_country)

## 6. String Manipulations for Reformatting Match Dates ##

match_matrix <- str_split(scores$match_date, " ", simplify = TRUE)

match_day <- match_matrix[,1]

## 7. Padding Strings ##

match_matrix <- str_split(scores$match_date, " ", simplify = TRUE)
match_day <- match_matrix[,1]

scores <- scores %>%
        mutate(match_day = str_pad(match_matrix[,1],2,side="left",pad=0))

match_day_length <- str_length(scores$match_day)




## 8. Creating New Variables ##

scores <- scores %>%
    mutate(win_goals=if_else(home_country == win_country,
                             home_goals,
                             away_goals),
           lose_goals=if_else(home_country == win_country,
                             away_goals,
                             home_goals)) 


## 9. Combining Strings to Create Match Summaries ##

match_summary <- str_c(scores$win_country,
                       " beat ",
                       scores$lose_country,
                       " on ",
                       scores$match_month,
                       " ",
                       scores$match_day,
                       " 2014 with scores of ",
                       scores$win_goals,
                       " to ",
                       scores$lose_goals)
