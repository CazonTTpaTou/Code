## 1. R Functions as Alternatives to Loops ##

library(readr)
scores <- read_csv("scores.csv")

## 3. A Vectorized Function for If-Else Statements ##

tied_matches <- if_else(scores$away_goals==scores$home_goals,"tie","did not tie")



## 4. Multiple Cases: Nesting Functions to Chain If-Else Statements ##

home_team_result <- if_else(scores$home_goals>scores$away_goals,"win",if_else(scores$away_goals>scores$home_goals,"lose","tie"))

scores_2 <- scores %>% mutate(home_team_result)



## 6. Grouping and Summarizing Data Frames ##

home_goals_sum <- scores %>% 
    group_by(home_country) %>% 
    summarize(sum(home_goals))










## 7. Summarizing a Data Frame by Multiple Variables ##

away_results <- scores %>% 
        group_by(away_country) %>%
        summarize(total = sum(away_goals),
                  average = mean(away_goals),
                  min = min(away_goals),
                  max = max(away_goals))



## 8. Chaining Functions Together Using the Pipe Operator ##

brazil_goals <- scores %>%
    filter(home_country == 'Brazil' | away_country == 'Brazil') %>%
    mutate(total_goals = home_goals + away_goals) %>%
    arrange(desc(total_goals))
